    <p>French Fries are a Jazz-Funk outfit from Tomsk in Russia. They're best known in funk circles as the pioneers of the Baltic Funk Movement of the 80's. Founded in 1979 by lifelong friends, drummer Yaroslav Fedorov and bassist Marat Ivanov. The band enjoyed moderate success in Russia but never broke America and the UK (although they had an underground following in the UK thanks to Radio One's John Peel).</p>

    <br>
    <p> In 1985 they attempted to break America by sending Sylvester Stallone a demo of an instrumental they were working on which they hoped would be included on the upcoming Rocky IV soundtrack. "We found out there was to be a Russian character in the upcoming Rocky movie, so we thought we'd send Mr Stallone an idea we had, sadly it wasn't to be." recalls Marat, "To me, this was the start of our demise, it shattered our confidence." Shortly after their Live In Tomsk album was released in December 1986 they cancelled their upcoming touring commitments and called time on the band. Yaroslav adds, "It was a sad day when we quit, Marat and I drank in our local bar, cried and bid farewell to our beautiful band, we knew it had run its cause."

      <p> <mark>Thankfully, 31 years later, they've reformed the band with the original lineup and are raring to go. They have a new album in the pipeline and hope to introduce their brand of Baltic Funk to a new generation of fans. "These days the kids are always on their phones", muses Yaroslav, "We thought we'd try and get our music out there with an app, these kids listen to music on their phone, I prefer vinyl, but we must keep up with the times, hence our app."</mark></p>
